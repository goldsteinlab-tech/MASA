\title{Find Overlapping Indices in A (Parallel)}
\usage{
OverlappingIndexAParallel(A, B, mc.cores = MCCORES)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{Data frame. Columns: 'chr', 'st', 'ed'.}

\item{B}{Data frame. Columns: 'chr', 'st', 'ed'.}

\item{mc.cores}{Integer. Number of cores for parallel processing.}
}
\value{
Integer vector of indices in A that overlap with B.
}
\description{
Finds indices of intervals in A that overlap with intervals in B, processing by chromosome and optionally in parallel.
}
\examples{
#A <- data.frame(chr = c("chr1", "chr1"), st = c(100, 200), ed = c(150, 250))
#B <- data.frame(chr = c("chr1", "chr1"), st = c(120, 220), ed = c(170, 270))
#OverlappingIndexAParallel(A, B, mc.cores = 2)
