\title{Merge Two Frequency Tables}
\usage{
merge_two_frequency_tables(file1, file2, outfile)

merge_two_frequency_tables(file1, file2, outfile)
}
\arguments{
\item{file1}{Character. Path to the first frequency table.}

\item{file2}{Character. Path to the second frequency table.}

\item{outfile}{Character. Path to the output file.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the merged frequency table with columns: ObCuts, GenomicPositionCount, ObCutRatio, GPRatio, and CorrectionFactor.
The merged table is also written to the specified output file.

None. Writes the merged table to \code{outfile}.
}
\description{
Merges two frequency tables with identical genomic position counts, sums observed cuts, and calculates ratios and correction factors.

Merges two frequency tables with identical genomic positions, sums observed cuts, and computes ratios and correction factors.
