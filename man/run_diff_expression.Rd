\title{Run Differential Expression Analysis with HOMER}
\usage{
run_diff_expression(
  homer_bin,
  work_dir,
  annotate_outfile,
  diffexp_outfile,
  group1,
  group2,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{homer_bin}{Character. Path to HOMER binaries.}

\item{work_dir}{Character. Working directory.}

\item{annotate_outfile}{Character. Path to annotation output file.}

\item{diffexp_outfile}{Character. Output file for differential expression results.}

\item{group1}{Character vector. Sample names for group 1.}

\item{group2}{Character vector. Sample names for group 2.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, prints progress messages (default: TRUE).}
}
\value{
None. Writes differential expression results to \code{diffexp_outfile}.
}
\description{
Runs HOMER's getDiffExpression.pl to perform differential expression analysis between two groups.
